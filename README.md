# Path-Loss-measumerent

This proyect outlines the methodology, results, analysis, and key conclusions of the path loss measurement project conducted for a telecommunications antenna situated in the central area of Santiago, Chile. The project focuses on evaluating the signal degradation, or path loss, experienced by radio waves as they propagate from the antenna across the urban environment. This study provides insights into the performance of the antenna, considering various environmental factors and urban challenges. We will delve into the techniques used for measurement, the data collected, and the implications of these findings for improving communication network efficiency in the city.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and quantify the path loss of a telecommunications antenna located in the central area of Santiago, Chile. This includes understanding how signal strength deteriorates over distance and identifying the factors contributing to this degradation, particularly in dense urban environments. The results aim to enhance the efficiency and reliability of urban communication networks.

Secondary objectives include:

Evaluating the impact of urban infrastructure, such as buildings and street layouts, on signal propagation.
Assessing the effectiveness of empirical path loss models, such as Okumura-Hata and Friis, by comparing their predictions with measured data.
Developing tools and methodologies for systematic data collection, analysis, and visualization of path loss metrics.
Providing actionable insights for optimizing antenna placement and network design in similar urban settings.
